# CNN

1. Implemented a CNN model from scratch on the CIFAR-10 Dataset. Incorporated Convolutional layer,
Max-Pooling layer, and Fully Connected layer and used ReLu as the activation function
2. Re-Implemented the same network using PyTorch and analysed over various parameters like - Optimiser, Scheduler, Learning Rate, No. of Epochs, Batch Size, and Loss function.
3. Analysed the effect of Data Augmentation on the CNN and added transforms like rotation, horizontal flip.
